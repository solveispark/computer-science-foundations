# computer-science-foundations
Hello! My name is Maroua, and I am a computer science student.
This repository represents the beginnin of my intentional self learning journey in computer science.
I created this repository to build strong foundations in progress as I learn how to think like a developer.
WHAT THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN:
-Programming practice (Python and later other languages) 
- Notes about computer science concepts
- Small excercises amd experiments
- Reflections on what I learn
- This repository will also serve as part of my future portfolio
- My goal is to gradually build projects that reflect real life use cases.
