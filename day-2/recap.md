#day 2 - recap 
## Focus
Algorithmic thinking and cs50 week0 (Introduction to Computer Science)
## What I learned 
- An algorithm is a step-by-step way to solve a problem.
- Before coding, I should think about the logic first.
- Conditions if/else allow a program to make decision.
- Loops allow repetition.
- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing mistakes.
## Reflection
Today was more about thinking than coding.
I realised that understanding a concept is different from being able to explain it clearly.
I am working on improving both my technical understanding and my ability to express it.
